TODO:

- Have timing for pointing tasks be offset from stroop task. Both before and after (0.5-1.5s). Need to ensure even amount, and to have no case of after, before, without having at least 1 stroop test between them.
    - Have timing configurable through API.
    - have pointing task fixed for non-distractor, or also very timing so not consistent?
- Save pointing and stroop sequence to file with timestamps (ideally ahead of starting, so not needing to write to disk during the test)
- Have stroop websocket used to also display countdown before test start.
